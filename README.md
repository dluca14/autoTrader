<b>Intelligent auto-trader for cryptocurrency</b>

In financial research, one of the major topics is asset pricing prediction. The proposal is a system employing Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to predict the cryptocurrency values on time horizons ranging from 1 minute to 1 day. Connecting to various cryptocurrency markets via APIs and additional sources of information (e.g. Twitter), the system shall use live trading data to enable a configurable ‘auto-trader’ option based on the output predictions of the ML algorithms. By combining blockchain-based features and sentiment-based information, the automatic trading option shall be allowed to use real cryptocurrency for maximizing the profit of the user.
